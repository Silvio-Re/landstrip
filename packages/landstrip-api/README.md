# @landstrip/landstrip-api

Node.js wrapper and types for Landstrip. Requires Node.js ≥18; native binaries
support Linux, macOS, and Windows on x64/arm64.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev @landstrip/landstrip-api
```

See the [quick start](../../README.md#quick-start) for a policy and CLI example;
[landstrip(1)](../landstrip/man/man1/landstrip.1) covers policy and platform limits.

## Node.js API

```js
const { execFileSync } = require("node:child_process");
const { binaryPath } = require("@landstrip/landstrip-api");

execFileSync(binaryPath(), ["run", "-p", "policy.json", "--", "cargo", "test"], {
  stdio: "inherit",
});
```

`binaryPath()` resolves an official installed binary or throws; `packageName()`
returns its package name. Both accept `platform` and `arch`, defaulting to the
current process.

[`lib/index.d.ts`](lib/index.d.ts) exports `LandstripTrap` and
`LandstripControlResponse`, and [`/proxy`](lib/proxy.d.ts) exports the proxy
helpers. [`/shared`](lib/shared.d.ts) provides:

- `decodeLandstripTrap(value)` / `parseTrapLine(line)`: validated trap or `null`.
  Extra fields survive; missing/unknown denial states become `info`, never queries.
- `isQueryTrap(trap)`: narrows validated events to `LandstripQueryTrap`.
  Query IDs are decimal `u64` strings, nonzero for queries.
- `writeLandstripPolicyFile(policy, prefix = 'landstrip-')`: returns `{ dir, path }`.
  Remove `dir` with `rmSync(dir, { recursive: true, force: true })` after use.
  Failed writes clean up; failed cleanup reports both errors and the directory
  path in an `AggregateError`.

## macOS log correlation

Both `LandstripDarwinPolicy` and `SandboxDarwinConfig` accept optional
`logTag?: string`, under the JSON key `macos` (not `darwin`):

```js
const { buildLandstripPolicy } = require("@landstrip/landstrip-api/shared");
const policy = buildLandstripPolicy({ macos: { logTag: "agent-session-42" } });
```

`macos.logTag` tags Seatbelt denial logs for correlation. It must be nonempty
and contain no double quote, backslash, ASCII control character (0x00–0x1f),
or DEL (0x7f). `null` is invalid. `buildLandstripPolicy` and `parseSandboxConfig`
validate and forward it; `deepMergeSandboxConfig` uses the override tag when
provided, otherwise preserving the base tag.

## Trap transport and reporting

On Unix, `--trap FD|PATH` accepts either an inherited open FD ≥3 or an absolute
Unix domain stream socket path. Start the socket listener before launching
Landstrip: the host Landstrip process connects before sandbox setup, and the
sandboxed child never inherits the trap transport.

On Linux, the stream is bidirectional and uses the existing broker query
protocol, not merely passive monitoring. For `state: "query"` events, reply on
the same socket with `controlResponseLine(trap.query_id, "allow")` (or `"deny"`);
the syscall waits for an answer. Completed events have `state: "info"`.
Explicit read denials (`DenyMatch`, JSON `reason: "deny_match"`) are reported
even when the command exits 0. macOS reports setup/launch failures on the trap
transport and closes it on successful exec; use Seatbelt logs for runtime denials.

## Development

Run `make ci` from the repository root.
