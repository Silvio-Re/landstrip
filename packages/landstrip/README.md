# landstrip

This package builds the `landstrip` binary that the CLI and the Node.js API
run, and ships its [man page](man/man1/landstrip.1). The binary enforces the
policy with Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS, and AppContainer on Windows.
Run `landstrip --help` for the command list.

## Build

```sh
make test
